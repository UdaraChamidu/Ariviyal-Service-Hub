Project Title: UniHub - The Ultimate University Service Platform Tech Stack: React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons), Vite.

Role: You are a Senior React Developer and UI/UX Designer.

Goal: Build a modern, responsive Progressive Web App (PWA) called "UniHub" that connects university students with local services. The design should be clean, trustworthy, and mobile-first.

Core Features to Build:

Navigation Bar:

Sticky top bar.

Logo: "UniHub" with a graduation cap or location icon.

Desktop Links: Browse, Map View, Community, Emergency.

"Post Ad" Button: A prominent Call-to-Action button.

Mobile Menu: Hamburger menu for smaller screens.

Hero Section:

Headline: "Everything a Student Needs, In One Place."

Sub-headline: "Find boarding, food delivery, tuk-tuks, and sold textbooks nearby."

Search Bar: Large, central input field with a search icon.

Category System (Scrollable):

Horizontal scroll view on mobile.

Categories: Boarding (Home icon), Food (Utensils), Transport (Car), Market (Shopping Bag), Jobs (Briefcase), Laundry (Shirt).

Listing Feed (The Core):

Display listings in a responsive grid (1 col mobile, 3 col desktop).

Card Design:

Image at top (use reliable placeholders from Unsplash).

"Verified" Badge: Green checkmark if the poster is a verified student/landlord.

Title & Price (e.g., "Rs. 8,500/month").

Location (e.g., "Wijemanne Road - 500m to gate").

Rating: Star rating (e.g., 4.5) with review count.

"Contact" Button: Opens a modal or shows phone number.

Interactive Map Toggle:

Add a toggle button to switch between "List View" and "Map View".

For the Map View, show a placeholder interactive map UI with pins.

"Post Ad" Flow (with Auth Gate):

When a user clicks "Post Ad", check if they are logged in.

If NOT logged in: Show a beautiful Login Modal (Mock "Sign in with Google" and "Student Email Verification").

If logged in: Show a form to add Title, Category, Price, and Upload Image.

AI Assistant (Chatbot):

Floating Action Button (FAB) at the bottom right.

On click, open a chat window.

UI: Chat interface where the user can ask "Where can I find cheap rice and curry?" and the bot replies (mock the response logic for now).

Emergency Page:

A dedicated section for "University Medical Center," "Campus Security," and "Police" with direct "Tap to Call" buttons.

Design Guidelines:

Color Palette: Primary Blue (#2563EB) and Indigo (#4F46E5) to signify trust and education. Backgrounds should be light gray (#F9FAFB) for contrast.

Typography: Sans-serif (Inter or Roboto).

Mobile Experience: Ensure touch targets (buttons) are large enough for thumbs.

Data Structure (Mock Data):

Create a robust mockData.js file with at least 6 sample listings across different categories to showcase the UI.

Implementation Instructions:

Use lucide-react for all icons.

Use framer-motion for smooth transitions (modals, hover effects) if possible.

Keep the code modular (separate components for Navbar, ListingCard, CategoryFilter, ChatBot).
